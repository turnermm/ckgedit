The Scayt spellchecker offers three Configuration Options: on, off, disabled. As of now, the default setting will be **off** instead of **on**.  With **on** the contents of the editor is parsed by Scayt and sent for spell-checking to a Scayt server. While there is no reason to believe this is a security risk, nevertheless this change is being made out of consideration for users with private wikis who may feel anxious having their data sent to a remote server. When set to “disable” The spell checker is removed entirely. Further information can be found in the Configuration Options page of the ckgedit documentation at https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:ckgedit:configuration#scayt_auto.
